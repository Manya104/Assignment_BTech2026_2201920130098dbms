platform used:tuf+;

Explanation:-
This Java program defines a `Student` class with private fields `name` and `rollNumber` to store a student's details. It includes:

1. **Constructors**:  
   - A default constructor initializing the fields to default values (`""` and `0`).  
   - A parameterized constructor to initialize fields with given values.

2. **Methods**:  
   - `setDetails` to set the student's name and roll number.  
   - `displayDetails` to print the student's details.

The `main` method in the `day1` class creates a `Student` object, sets its details using `setDetails`, and prints the details with `displayDetails`.
